[00:19.21] I'm standing on the bridge
[00:21.68] I'm waiting in the dark
[00:24.07] I thought that you'd be here by now
[00:28.99] There's nothing but the rain
[00:31.31] No footsteps on the ground
[00:33.40] I'm listening but there's no sound
[00:38.82] Isn't anyone trying to find me?
[00:43.39] Won't somebody come take me home?
[00:47.36] It's a damn cold night
[00:52.12] Tryin' to figure out this life
[00:56.73] Won't you take me by the hand
[00:59.15] Take me somewhere new?
[01:01.50] I don't know who you are, but I
[01:05.82] I'm with you
[01:10.64] I'm with you, mm
[01:16.50] I'm looking for a place
[01:18.74] I'm searching for a face
[01:20.82] Is anybody here I know?
[01:25.37] 'Cause nothing's going right
[01:28.01] And everything's a mess
[01:30.23] And no one likes to be alone
[01:35.52] Isn't anyone trying to find me?
[01:40.33] Won't somebody come take me home?
[01:44.11] It's a damn cold night
[01:48.64] Trying to figure out this life
[01:53.28] Won't you take me by the hand
[01:55.60] Take me somewhere new?
[01:58.38] I don't know who you are, but I
[02:02.88] I'm with you
[02:07.65] I'm with you, yeah-yeah
[02:13.04] Oh, why is everything so confusing?
[02:18.20] Maybe I'm just out of my mind
[02:22.14] Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
[02:25.11] Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
[02:31.59] It's a damn cold night
[02:36.05] Trying to figure out this life
[02:40.83] Won't you take me by the hand
[02:43.32] Take me somewhere new?
